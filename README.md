Coffee Sales Dashboard in Excel

This project presents a dashboard analyzing coffee sales data using Excel, providing key insights into customer behavior, distribution of orders by country, and product performance over time. The data spans three sheets—Orders, Customers, and Products—and has been cleaned, standardized, and analyzed to offer a comprehensive view of the coffee sales data.


Data Preparation and Cleaning:

Before building the dashboard, the following data cleaning steps were performed:

1. Populating Missing Values: Used VLOOKUP and INDEX MATCH to fill missing values across sheets.
2. Standardizing Data: Updated entries in the coffee type and roast type columns for clarity (e.g., changed "ara" to "Arabica" and "L" to "Light").
3. Formatting Adjustments: Reformatted the size column to include "kg" for clarity (e.g., "0.5 kg").


Dashboard Insights and Filters:

The dashboard uses pivot tables and pivot charts to present insights, including:

1. Top 7 Customers: Shows the highest-spending customers based on order data.
2. Sales by Country: Visualizes the distribution of sales across different countries.
3. Sales by Coffee Type: Tracks monthly sales divided by four coffee types, 

Filters have been added to allow for dynamic exploration:

Date Filter: Select a range of months and years.
Loyalty Card Filter: Filter data based on loyalty card holders.
Roast Type Filter: View sales by specific roast types.
